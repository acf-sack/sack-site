                            <h1>History of the College</h1>
                            <h2>1904 - 1954</h2>
                        </div>
                        <p> In the year 1906, Fr. Craner was made to
                            relinquish the post of
                            Principal, which he did with a deep sense of sadness, but with a feeling of discipline
                            and obedience, as his
                            services were needed elsewhere. He had already groomed his successor, Fr. D. Philip
                            Caspersz OSB who was
                            already a member of the teaching staff. After Fr. Caspersz assumed duties as Principal,
                            his brother, Fr.
                            James came in as Boarding Prefect. These two brothers, in a comparatively short time
                            changed the status of
                            the school, making it a College. On 20th of December 1907, the Annual Distribution of
                            Prizes was held for
                            the first time on a grand scale. The Rt. Revd. Dr. C. Pagnani OSB - Bishop of Kandy was
                            the Chief Guest, and
                            along with Fr. D.A. Pancrazi OSB, he distributed 100 prizes amongst a total student
                            population of 275. The
                            ceremony was held in what was called the "Big College Hall" measuring 100' x 27'. The
                            programme opened with
                            a rendering of the chorus 'Over the Hill' by the College Choir and ended with chanting
                            of the 'Papal Hymn'
                            and National Anthem. 'Electricity &amp; Magnetism' was introduced as a subject of the
                            'Cambridge Classes' in
                            this year.<br><br>

                            &nbsp;Along with Fr. Van Langenberg who was prefect of games, Fr. Philip would spend
                            most evenings
                            encouraging and cheering on his students on the playing field at Barrack Square. The
                            'Cricket, Hockey &amp;
                            Football Club' (CH&amp;FC) was formed to promote sports at College. St. Anthony's became
                            the first College
                            to play Hockey, in the year 1907. 17 matches were played with 10 of them won, 4 lost and
                            3 drawn. Amongst
                            the opposition teams were the likes of Indian Rajput Regiment, Colombo Municipality and
                            Bloomfield. Two
                            Football matches were played, winning one and drawing one and five Cricket matches were
                            played winning four
                            and drawing one. The first 'Trinity-Antonian' cricket encounter was played in that same
                            year, with the
                            Antonians emerging winners by 14 runs. The irony of it all was that we lost the use of
                            Barrack Square in
                            that year, when debarred by the Military authorities. However, in 1908 the Kandy
                            Municipal Council granted
                            exclusive use of the Reclamation Grounds for College sports.<br><br>

                            The roll of students increased to 300 in 1908. Two pupils secured passes in Senior
                            Division and five in
                            Junior Division 'Cambridge' exams. 'Physiology &amp; Hygiene' was introduced as a
                            subject of the 'Cambridge
                            Classes'. Athletics began to feature prominently in the sports arena, with two Antonian
                            students; D. Vincent
                            Silva and P.M. John, securing first places in the highest class of the Flat Race and the
                            High Jump
                            respectively, in the annual 'Empire Day' celebrations held in Kandy on the 2nd of May
                            1908. The College
                            Sports meet was held on 4th December 1908 with a list of events described as follows ;
                            Flat Races, Putting
                            the Shot, Throwing the Cricket Ball, Kicking the Football, Long Jump, Three-legged Race,
                            High Jump, Hockey
                            Dribbling, Egg &amp; Spoon Race, Hurdle Race, Bun-Eating Competition, Quarter Mile Race,
                            Chattie Race,
                            Obstacle Race, Zoo Race and a Thread &amp; Needle Race for Old Boys.<img
                                class="img-thumbnail img-responsive" src="img/Red-Brick.jpg" alt="Red Brick" align=left
                                style="margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px;"><br><br>
                            The first ever College publication was released as "St. Anthony's Manual", in 1908,
                            featuring 53 pages of
                            articles and comprehensive reports on all activities of the college. The old red
                            building near the Bishop's
                            Palace was soon replaced by new buildings that came up in quick succession in the area
                            of the coffee store
                            and the old cemetery.<br><br>

                            The year 1909, ended in sadness for the whole school and most of Kandy, when College was
                            robbed of one of
                            its most promising pupils; the little 12-year-old Charlie Hamilton, who had represented
                            the College First XI
                            Teams in Cricket, Football and Hockey with some heroic performances in that year, before
                            his untimely death
                            on 5th&nbsp;of November. The newly equipped Physical Laboratory was specially dedicated
                            to the memory of
                            little Charlie Hamilton.<br><br>

                            In 1910, Fr. Basil Hyde OSB, an old boy of the college who was a member of the staff, at
                            the request of
                            several old boys summoned a meeting on 26th&nbsp;of December 1910 at the College Hall,
                            where the 'First
                            Annual General Meeting' of 'St. Anthony's Old Boys' Association' was held.Very Rev. Fr.
                            Bede Beeckmeyer was
                            elected the first President of the Association proposed by Fr. Hyde himself. In 1912,
                            when Fr. Beeckmeyer
                            was consecrated 'Bishop', Fr. Basil Hyde succeeded him as President of the O.B.A. A
                            total of 152 members had
                            joined the association in its first two years. The first Branch of the O.B.A. was formed
                            on 24thFebruary
                            1912 as the 'Uva Branch', with Rev. Fr. D.M.Craner OSB elected as President, at a
                            meeting held at St.
                            Mary's, Badulla.<img class="img-thumbnail img-responsive"

                            In 1911, St. Anthony's College played its first inter-collegiate Football match, beating
                            Kingswood College
                            by two goals to nil. Boxing was introduced to St. Anthony's around 1914, at the same
                            time that Royal,
                            Wesley, Trinity and St. Thomas' took to the sport. The first ever Boxing Tournament in
                            the Island was
                            conducted in 1914, for the 'Stubbs Shield', and St. Anthony's was amongst the teams that
                            participated.<br>

                            Due to ill health, Fr. Philip Caspersz, who had been Principal for nearly a decade, was
                            shifted to hibernate
                            within the monastic walls of reclusion, and a younger man in the person of Fr. Basil
                            Hyde, served as
                            Principal during 1915, until a more permanent appointment was made.<br>

                            In November 1915, at the close of Fr. Basil Hyde's temporary tenure of office, Fr. James
                            Caspersz OSB, whose
                            association with the college began as Art Master before his ordination in 1906, was
                            appointed Principal. He
                            immediately engaged in the expansion of the College by meeting the long felt need for
                            better and spacious
                            accommodation. In October 1916 a new wing of the College was declared open by Mr.
                            E.B.Denham, Director of
                            Education, thus providing adequate laboratory facilities<br><br><img

                            In November 1915, at the close of Fr. Basil Hyde's temporary tenure of office, Fr. James
                            Caspersz OSB, whose
                            association with the college began as Art Master before his ordination in 1906, was
                            appointed Principal. He
                            immediately engaged in the expansion of the College by meeting the long felt need for
                            better and spacious

                            Education, thus providing adequate laboratory facilities for Chemistry and Physics. In
                            1917, the Department
                            of Education officially recognized St. Anthony's College as a 'Fully Organized Secondary
                            School'. An Infants
                            Department for children aged 3-6 years was inaugurated.<img

                            Day' was held on
                            15th December 1917, after a lapse of three years due the 1st world war, with the
                            Honourable Chief Justice
                            Sir Alex Wood Renton, presiding. Mr. William Gopallawa, the last Governor General of
                            Ceylon and first
                            President of Sri Lanka, was among the students who successfully completed the London
                            Matriculation
                            Examination during this year. The first telephone was installed in College during that
                            year.<br><br>

                            The highlight of his term of office was the College's performance in the field of sport.
                            Being a
                            stouthearted sportsman himself, he chose to infuse in his lads the truest type of
                            sporting spirit viz; Win
                            or Lose it's how you play the game that matters. Consequently, in Boxing (the straight
                            lefts), Cricket (the
                            record breaking Jack Anderson) and Cadetting (the De Soysa Cup), the College achieved
                            success and
                            recognition.<br><br>

                            However, for all the achievements of this era, the one that has stood the time-of-test
                            is the individual
                            score of 291 runs by the legendary Jack Anderson, in a match against St. Thomas' College
                            Mount Lavinia,
                            played at Colombo in 1918. This remains to date the highest individual score in school
                            cricket. He also
                            scored five centuries in five successive matches and was the first to score a century at
                            what is now the
                            International Cricket Stadium at Asgiriya, besides also being the first to score a
                            century against St.
                            Thomas'. In Boxing, St. Anthony's who were runners-up in the much coveted Stubbs' Shield
                            Competition on two
                            previous occasions, won the trophy for the first time in 1918.Thanks to the likes of
                            Robert Wright, L.V.
                            Jayaweera, N.H. Keerthiratne and the many other Boxers produced during this era, the
                            Antonians remained a
                            formidable force through the 1920's. Though Cadetting had been introduced to St.
                            Anthony's in 1912, it was
                            not until 1916/1917 that our Cadets were able to make an impression at the annual
                            Inter-School Cadet
                            Competitions in Colombo, for the handsome 'De Soysa Cup'.<br><br>

                            In May 1921, Fr. D. Lawrence Hyde OSB succeeded Fr. James Caspersz as Principal of St.
                            Anthony's, and his
                            administration reflected the energizing spirit of his strong personality, to open new
                            vistas in the history
                            of the College. By this time the premises next to the Cathedral had been fully developed
                            with the student
                            population topping one thousand. Several representations were made for the transfer of
                            St. Anthony's from
                            the cramped precincts to more spacious grounds, but to no avail. Finally, it was in 1927
                            that Bishop Bede
                            Beeckmeyer, an old Antonian himself, purchased the old 'Dunuwille Walauwa', the present
                            premises. The site
                            was eminently suitable and the beauty of the surrounding scenery certainly enhanced it.
                            The river, all along
                            one side of the site, views of Hunnasgiriya and Hantane on two sides and wide stretches
                            of smiling open
                            country on all sides.<br><br>

                            The plague hit Kandy by the end of 1927 and Fr. Hyde obtained the Bishop's permission to
                            shift at least the
                            junior boarders out of Kandy to Katugastota. The renovating and reconditioning of the
                            new premises thus
                            began in November 1927. A mass of kitchens and stables had to be turned into
                            dormitories, dining halls and
                            common rooms. With drains all around, outer walls had to be bound to the grounds, the
                            inner walls removed
                            and replaced by pillars and the roof supported by trusses - a combined feat of
                            engineering no modern
                            engineer would attempt. Thanks to Bro. Lysons and the lab-boy William, water service was
                            installed and Titus
                            lamps provided the lighting. The classes were housed in a shed made of coconut pillars,
                            mango rafters,
                            corrugated iron roof and wattle-and-daub dwarf walls<img

                            On 16th January 1928, the junior boarders were installed at Katugastota with a solemn
                            planting of trees to
                            commemorate the event. The verandah of the old walauwa served as a chapel. Odds and ends
                            served as an altar
                            until one was made on 29th January and the place was consecrated to the sacred heart of
                            Jesus. Fr. Principal
                            himself occupied a room between the kindergarten and the study hall.<br>
                            Fr. Lawrence Hyde built a formidable team of pioneers - Mr. P.B.A.Weerakoon, Bro.
                            Columban Macky, Bro.
                            Joseph, Bro. Lysons and Bro. Timothy - to set about his vision of transformation that
                            today seems
                            unbelievable. Fr. D.D. Barsenbach OSB who was appointed Director of Boarders in 1937
                            complemented this team.
                            Classes were started for the boarders and others who cared to come over.<br>
                            Two lads came all the way past the Kandy school to be in the temporary classes and to
                            share in the spirit of
                            the new St. Anthony's College, which was rising phoenix-like out of the ashes of the
                            old. During the first
                            few years the school held classes for Kindergarten up to Cambridge Junior, with an
                            approximate staff of
                            around twelve, gradually increasing the range to the London Matriculation and an
                            Inter-Arts form.<br>
                            In 1929, Fr. Hyde had the first permanent set of open classrooms erected alongside the
                            river, which today
                            houses the primary school. It was here, that in 1934, St. Anthony's obtained the best
                            results in the British
                            Empire with 100% passes in the London Matriculation Examination. Twelve candidates were
                            presented for the
                            Examination and all passed. Healthy rivalry was enjoyed by the Katugastota boys with
                            their counterparts from
                            the Kandy school in the matter of success at the Examinations, and more often than not,
                            the Kandy youngsters
                            had to congratulate the Katugastota lads on their performance.<br><br>

                        Even in the field of sports, the lads of Katugastota had the better of their
                        counterparts from Kandy in
                        cricket and athletics, first in the under 16 division and later in the
                        1st&nbsp;Division. From 1936 - 1938,
                        more than half the 1st&nbsp;XI cricket team were from the Katugastota school. The boys
                        from Katugastota
                        belonged in those days to the Maroon House while those at Kandy were in the Light and
                        Dark Blue Houses.<br>

                        The first playing field at Katugastota was the narrow strip of ground near the entrance
                        on which the present
                        Centenary Hall stands. The old Walauwa too is no more. It lies buried under the earth of
                        the present
                        playground. The land around the old Walauwa was thick with cocoa and coconut trees,
                        where cobras roamed. The
                        boys themselves helped in mopping out operations and the planning and clearing of these
                        areas for vegetable
                        cultivation.<br>

                        In 1935, Fr. Hyde completed the main building block of the school and its counterpart
                        running parallel to
                        it. They stand tall to this day to his credit. The hostellers, who had by then increased
                        to about 150, had
                        their dormitories upstairs in the main block while the Office; Hall, Library and Chapel
                        were on the ground
                        floor. The smaller section behind which then consisted of a single storey, contained
                        dining rooms and some
                        classrooms. The playing field too was gradually expanded to its present size, thanks to
                        Fr. Van Reyk's share
                        in it. Fr. Robert Perera had the first Pavilion built at this time.<br><br>

                        On the 1st&nbsp;of November 1941, the Kandy branch was officially separated from St.
                        Anthony's College, now
                        well established at Katugastota, and a new school under the name of 'St. Sylvester's
                        College' was
                        established with Fr. Robert Perera OSB as the first Principal.<br>

                        During his record tenure of 23 years (1921 - 1943) as Principal of St. Anthony's, Fr.
                        Lawrence Hyde achieved
                        spectacular triumphs in the academic field as well as in sports. On the eve of his
                        career as Principal,
                        World War II brought a dark period through the military occupation of the College.
                        Throughout it all, Fr.
                        Hyde's spirit animated the skeleton that survived for four years in private houses and
                        cadjan sheds into
                        which she moved through compulsion. The total student population shrank to about 300 of
                        which about 50 were
                        boarders. Of all its Principals of the past, St. Anthony's must be proud of Fr. Lawrence
                        Hyde OSB; not only
                        as it's architect, but also for guiding with a sure hand it's destinies through a period
                        of 23 years of
                        stress, strain and turmoil. His tenure as Principal remains the longest, to
                        date.<br><br>

                        &nbsp;In 1944, Fr. Angelo Rosati became Principal, being nominated by Fr. Hyde to carry
                        on the task he had
                        begun in a manner that would raise the prestige of the College as an educational
                        institution of high
                        standards and also restore the reputation for sports, which had been sidelined for four
                        years during
                        military occupation of the College. When the release of the buildings and the playing
                        field came around
                        1946, one of the first innovations conceived by Fr. Theophane Wickramaratne, who led the
                        triumphal return of
                        the boys to the premises, was the adoption of a cottage system for hostel accommodation.
                        Fr. Theophane was
                        also either instrumental or involved in the construction of many other College buildings
                        such as "The
                        Rainbow Cottages", The Tuck Shop", " The Chapel", "Mansion"' "Villa", "Infirmary", and
                        "The Refectory".
                        Living in small groups, in separate cottages had not only provided a homely atmosphere
                        but also promoted
                        greater fellowship and understanding. Fr. Rosati immediately reconditioned several
                        military huts into cosy,
                        comfortable living quarters for the boarders and appointed school matrons to be in
                        charge of the physical
                        cleanliness of the boys and the sanitary features of each hostel block. This change had
                        been so effectual in
                        the achievement of greater performance both in work and play and led to a remarkable
                        reduction of illness
                        among the boarders.<br><br>

                        During his sojourn on the Continent, England and the USA, Fr. Rosati was able to send
                        sufficient apparatus
                        to equip fully the Physics, Chemistry and Biology laboratories as well as the Geography
                        room, raising the
                        educational standards of the College on par with other leading schools of the Island.
                        The student population
                        grew to a near 1,600 with a teaching staff of 70, during this period. Classes were
                        conducted in English,
                        Sinhala and Tamil mediums for all subjects from Grade 1 to University Entrance.
