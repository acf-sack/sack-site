          <h2><b>Since 1854</b></h2>

          The Roman Catholic Church had established itself in the maritime areas from 1505.
          In 1820, the superior of all the Oratorians in Ceylon, Vincent de Rozairo,
          himself came as the first missionary to Kandy.
          He put up a church, which occupied the very same grounds whereon the present Scots Kirk stands.
          In 1828, the Scots Kirk site was found to be too small and hilly and
          accordingly a petition was submitted to the Governor-General Sir Edward Barnes
          who promptly presented the Catholic Church with a new site.
          It was roughly a square 152 ft. by 150 ft. upon which the second Roman Catholic Church was built.
          This is the very same site on which St. Anthony's Cathedral stands today.
          It was realized that building churches alone would not contribute
          to the success of the missionary efforts that commenced in 1820.
          <br>
          <br>

          In September 1843, an Italian Oratorian, Fr. Orazio Bettacchini was sent to the Kandyan mission who, during
          his missionary year 1843/44, opened a school in Kandy on the same premises. However, in August 1844, his
          successor Fr. Andrew J. Reinaud, who continued as missionary until 1848, began his missionary career by
          pulling down the school, which Fr. Bettacchini had put up. This was the subject of a letter of complaint
          made by Fr. Bettacchini himself.
          <br>
          <br>


          Yet, it was not until November 1853, when Fr. Felice Zoppi, a Franciscan from the Chinese missionary field
          was sent to Kandy by Monsignor Joseph Maria Bravi OSB, that Fr. Bettacchini's complaint was looked into. Fr.
          Zoppi promptly set about his task by opening a school for boys and one for girls at the house where he
          resided, in January of 1854, with a Mr. Van Twest as Head Teacher of the Boys School.
          <br>
          <br>



          This was the birth of St. Anthony's College. Soon after which, Fr. Zoppi obediently sent word to Mgr. Bravi
          through Fr. Leone Cingolani, informing him of his success in opening the schools. But the message was never
          delivered and Fr. Zoppi subsequently wrote to Mgr. Bravi who replied on 12th March 1854, officially
          acknowledging the opening of both schools, at the present premises of St. Anthony's Cathedral.
          <br>
          <br>


          Although it is said that; Fr. Zoppi, being a Franciscan, chose to name the school after their illustrious
          Saint, there is also evidence that the Church had been dedicated to St. Anthony at a much earlier date. The
          number of students on roll at the inception was 62 boys and 28 girls. The Girls School was shifted to
          Katukelle in 1887, where a Convent was opened for Good Shepherd Nuns.
          <br>

          <br>


          Mr. Paul Poorey took over the administration of the Boys School from Mr. Van Twest in 1855, contributing
          immensely to the efficiency and prestige the school enjoyed in its formative years. Fr. Zoppi left the
          country at the end of September 1856. In the absence of sufficient missionaries to take over the school,
          which was then a parish school, a succession of laymen in; M/s. F. Peiris, F. De Silva, K.A. Fernando, A.
          Staples, A.B. Geddes and O.D. Paul, carried on the administration until 1870. In 1867, St. Anthony's Boys'
          School was referred as the 'second best school in English' among all the schools established by the
          Missionaries.R_P_Jansz In 1870, the Irish Christian Brothers John and Paul took over the administration,
          temporarily. In 1871, the school was run by Mr. W. Hopp, who managed affairs until 1872 and handed the
          administration over to Mr. J. Jorden, who held the reigns until 1875 when Fr. Dom Hildebrand Vanderstraaten
          OSB was installed as Principal, marking the entrusting of the administration and management of the school to
          the Benedictine monks, who erected the Abbey of St. Anthony's in Kandy in 1874. Fr. D. Paul Perera O.S.B
          succeeded Fr. Vanderstraaten in 1876, in which year it is recorded that boarding life was first introduced,
          and in 1877 handed over to Fr. D.M. Craner, until 1879. In that year, due to the scarcity of missionaries,
          secular teachers managed the school with Mr. R.P. Jansz as Head Master from 1880 to 1892, working in harmony
          with the Benedictine Fathers over a period of twelve years during which time the school made very good
          progress. The student population by 1887 had grown to 92; 5 of whom were boarders. St. Anthony's Cathedral
          was built in 1876 on the initiative of Fr. Gingolani. Upon Mr. Jansz's retirement in 1892, the Benedictines
          appointed Fr. Hilarian Leitan OSB, who had only been ordained a priest in December 1891, as Principal. He
          continued for a period of six years until 1898.
          <br>
          <br>

            align="left">


          Fr. Leitan was the first, of an unbroken line of OSB Priest-Principals of the College, to date. During his
          six years in office, he had the services of a few other Benedictine monks - Dom Hildebrand Georgesz, Dom
          Patrick Mckelvie, Dom Dominic Direckze and for a short term, a Benedictine Father from Scotland, Rev. Ryan
          whose brothers were in charge of tea plantations. In 1894 the premises known as "Philips Coffee Store", now
          a part of St. Sylvester's College was purchased by Abbot Pancrazi for the school. St. Anthony's had no
          playing field then. The use of "Barrack Square" was secured in 1898, for the boys to practice sport.
          <br>
          <br>


          In January 1899, Fr. Maurus Craner OSB relieved Fr. Leitan as Principal of St. Anthony's. All aspects of
          higher education were included in the curriculum, that year. In the early days of Fr. Craner's stewardship,
          there were about fifteen boarders housed in a room under the belfry. Capitalizing on the new extent of land
          available, he put up buildings including more space to house the boarders, which soon grew to number about
          fifty. Fr. Craner was a workaholic, and only slept for about four hours a day, in order to perform his
          duties as Principal, Teacher, Prefect of Boarders, Accountant, Clerk - all rolled in one. Cricket was
          introduced by Fr. Andrew Vanlangenberg OSB in 1903, and a team known as 'St. Anthony's College Cricket Club'
          consisting of staff and school boys was formed under the captaincy of Fr. Andrew himself. The inaugural
          match was played in Colombo versus Colombo Carlton Cricket Club.
          <br>
          <br>
          The completion of the first fifty years was marked by the first ever schools cricket match involving St.
          Anthony's, which was played in 1904, against Dharmaraja College, with a 109-run victory for the Antonians.




          In the year 1906, Fr. Craner was made to relinquish the post of Principal, which he
          did
          with a deep sense of sadness, but with a feeling of discipline and obedience, as his services were needed
          elsewhere.
          He had already groomed his successor, Fr. D. Philip Caspersz OSB who was already a member of the teaching
          staff.
          After Fr. Caspersz assumed duties as Principal, his brother, Fr. James came in as Boarding Prefect. These
          two
          brothers, in a comparatively short time changed the status of the school, making it a College. On 20th of
          December
          1907, the Annual Distribution of Prizes was held for the first time on a grand scale. The Rt. Revd. Dr. C.
          Pagnani
          OSB - Bishop of Kandy was the Chief Guest, and along with Fr. D.A. Pancrazi OSB, he distributed 100 prizes
          amongst a
          total student population of 275. The ceremony was held in what was called the "Big College Hall" measuring
          100'
          x
          27'. The programme opened with a rendering of the chorus 'Over the Hill' by the College Choir and ended with
          chanting of the 'Papal Hymn' and National Anthem. 'Electricity &amp; Magnetism' was introduced as a subject
          of
          the
          'Cambridge Classes' in this year.<br><br>

          &nbsp;Along with Fr. Van Langenberg who was prefect of games, Fr. Philip would spend most evenings
          encouraging
          and
          cheering on his students on the playing field at Barrack Square. The 'Cricket, Hockey &amp; Football Club'
          (CH&amp;FC) was formed to promote sports at College. St. Anthony's became the first College to play Hockey,
          in
          the
          year 1907. 17 matches were played with 10 of them won, 4 lost and 3 drawn. Amongst the opposition teams were
          the
          likes of Indian Rajput Regiment, Colombo Municipality and Bloomfield. Two Football matches were played,
          winning
          one
          and drawing one and five Cricket matches were played winning four and drawing one. The first
          'Trinity-Antonian'
          cricket encounter was played in that same year, with the Antonians emerging winners by 14 runs. The irony of
          it
          all
          was that we lost the use of Barrack Square in that year, when debarred by the Military authorities. However,
          in
          1908
          the Kandy Municipal Council granted exclusive use of the Reclamation Grounds for College sports.<br><br>

          The roll of students increased to 300 in 1908. Two pupils secured passes in Senior Division and five in
          Junior
          Division 'Cambridge' exams. 'Physiology &amp; Hygiene' was introduced as a subject of the 'Cambridge
          Classes'.
          Athletics began to feature prominently in the sports arena, with two Antonian students; D. Vincent Silva and
          P.M.
          John, securing first places in the highest class of the Flat Race and the High Jump respectively, in the
          annual
          'Empire Day' celebrations held in Kandy on the 2nd of May 1908. The College Sports meet was held on 4th
          December
          1908 with a list of events described as follows ; Flat Races, Putting the Shot, Throwing the Cricket Ball,
          Kicking
          the Football, Long Jump, Three-legged Race, High Jump, Hockey Dribbling, Egg &amp; Spoon Race, Hurdle Race,
          Bun-Eating Competition, Quarter Mile Race, Chattie Race, Obstacle Race, Zoo Race and a Thread &amp; Needle
          Race
          for
          Old Boys.<img class="img-thumbnail img-responsive" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/Red-Brick.jpg"
            alt="Red Brick" align="left"><br><br>

          The first ever College publication was released as "St. Anthony's Manual", in 1908, featuring 53 pages of
          articles
          and comprehensive reports on all activities of the college. The old red building near the Bishop's Palace
          was
          soon
          replaced by new buildings that came up in quick succession in the area of the coffee store and the old
          cemetery.<br><br>

          The year 1909, ended in sadness for the whole school and most of Kandy, when College was robbed of one of
          its
          most
          promising pupils; the little 12-year-old Charlie Hamilton, who had represented the College First XI Teams in
          Cricket, Football and Hockey with some heroic performances in that year, before his untimely death on
          5th&nbsp;of
          November. The newly equipped Physical Laboratory was specially dedicated to the memory of little Charlie
          Hamilton.<br><br>

          In 1910, Fr. Basil Hyde OSB, an old boy of the college who was a member of the staff, at the request of
          several
          old
          boys summoned a meeting on 26th&nbsp;of December 1910 at the College Hall, where the 'First Annual General
          Meeting'
          of 'St. Anthony's Old Boys' Association' was held.Very Rev. Fr. Bede Beeckmeyer was elected the first
          President
          of
          the Association proposed by Fr. Hyde himself. In 1912, when Fr. Beeckmeyer was consecrated 'Bishop', Fr.
          Basil
          Hyde
          succeeded him as President of the O.B.A. A total of 152 members had joined the association in its first two
          years.
          The first Branch of the O.B.A. was formed on 24thFebruary 1912 as the 'Uva Branch', with Rev. Fr. D.M.Craner
          OSB
          elected as President, at a meeting held at St. Mary's, Badulla.<img class="img-thumbnail img-responsive"

            id="ContentPlaceHolder1_Image8" align="right"><br><br>

          In 1911, St. Anthony's College played its first inter-collegiate Football match, beating Kingswood College
          by
          two
          goals to nil. Boxing was introduced to St. Anthony's around 1914, at the same time that Royal, Wesley,
          Trinity
          and
          St. Thomas' took to the sport. The first ever Boxing Tournament in the Island was conducted in 1914, for the
          'Stubbs
          Shield', and St. Anthony's was amongst the teams that participated.<br>

          Due to ill health, Fr. Philip Caspersz, who had been Principal for nearly a decade, was shifted to hibernate
          within
          the monastic walls of reclusion, and a younger man in the person of Fr. Basil Hyde, served as Principal
          during
          1915,
          until a more permanent appointment was made.<br>

          In November 1915, at the close of Fr. Basil Hyde's temporary tenure of office, Fr. James Caspersz OSB, whose
          association with the college began as Art Master before his ordination in 1906, was appointed Principal. He
          immediately engaged in the expansion of the College by meeting the long felt need for better and spacious
          accommodation. In October 1916 a new wing of the College was declared open by Mr. E.B.Denham, Director of
          Education,
          thus providing adequate laboratory facilities<br><br><img class="img-thumbnail img-responsive"

          In November 1915, at the close of Fr. Basil Hyde's temporary tenure of office, Fr. James Caspersz OSB, whose

          immediately engaged in the expansion of the College by meeting the long felt need for better and spacious

          Education,
          thus providing adequate laboratory facilities for Chemistry and Physics. In 1917, the Department of
          Education
          officially recognized St. Anthony's College as a 'Fully Organized Secondary School'. An Infants Department
          for
          children aged 3-6 years was inaugurated.<img class="img-responsive"
            src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/history_2_William-Gopallawa.jpg" alt="William gopallawa" align="right"
            id="ContentPlaceHolder1_Image10">The 'Prize Giving Day' was held on 15th December 1917, after a lapse of
          three
          years due the 1st world war, with the Honourable Chief Justice Sir Alex Wood Renton, presiding. Mr. William
          Gopallawa, the last Governor General of Ceylon and first President of Sri Lanka, was among the students who
          successfully completed the London Matriculation Examination during this year. The first telephone was
          installed
          in
          College during that year.<br><br>

          The highlight of his term of office was the College's performance in the field of sport. Being a
          stouthearted
          sportsman himself, he chose to infuse in his lads the truest type of sporting spirit viz; Win or Lose it's
          how
          you
          play the game that matters. Consequently, in Boxing (the straight lefts), Cricket (the record breaking Jack
          Anderson) and Cadetting (the De Soysa Cup), the College achieved success and recognition.<br><br>

          <img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/history_2_Jack-Anderson.jpg"
            alt="Jack Anderson" id="ContentPlaceHolder1_Image9" align="left">
          However, for all the achievements of this era, the one that has stood the time-of-test is the individual
          score
          of
          291 runs by the legendary Jack Anderson, in a match against St. Thomas' College Mount Lavinia, played at
          Colombo
          in
          1918. This remains to date the highest individual score in school cricket. He also scored five centuries in
          five
          successive matches and was the first to score a century at what is now the International Cricket Stadium at
          Asgiriya, besides also being the first to score a century against St. Thomas'. In Boxing, St. Anthony's who
          were
          runners-up in the much coveted Stubbs' Shield Competition on two previous occasions, won the trophy for the
          first
          time in 1918.Thanks to the likes of Robert Wright, L.V. Jayaweera, N.H. Keerthiratne and the many other
          Boxers
          produced during this era, the Antonians remained a formidable force through the 1920's. Though Cadetting had
          been
          introduced to St. Anthony's in 1912, it was not until 1916/1917 that our Cadets were able to make an
          impression
          at
          the annual Inter-School Cadet Competitions in Colombo, for the handsome 'De Soysa Cup'.<br><br>

          In May 1921, Fr. D. Lawrence Hyde OSB succeeded Fr. James Caspersz as Principal of St. Anthony's, and his
          administration reflected the energizing spirit of his strong personality, to open new vistas in the history
          of
          the
          College. By this time the premises next to the Cathedral had been fully developed with the student
          population
          topping one thousand. Several representations were made for the transfer of St. Anthony's from the cramped
          precincts
          to more spacious grounds, but to no avail. Finally, it was in 1927 that Bishop Bede Beeckmeyer, an old
          Antonian
          himself, purchased the old 'Dunuwille Walauwa', the present premises. The site was eminently suitable and
          the
          beauty
          of the surrounding scenery certainly enhanced it. The river, all along one side of the site, views of
          Hunnasgiriya
          and Hantane on two sides and wide stretches of smiling open country on all sides.<br><br>

          The plague hit Kandy by the end of 1927 and Fr. Hyde obtained the Bishop's permission to shift at least the
          junior
          boarders out of Kandy to Katugastota. The renovating and reconditioning of the new premises thus began in
          November
          1927. A mass of kitchens and stables had to be turned into dormitories, dining halls and common rooms. With
          drains
          all around, outer walls had to be bound to the grounds, the inner walls removed and replaced by pillars and
          the
          roof
          supported by trusses - a combined feat of engineering no modern engineer would attempt. Thanks to Bro.
          Lysons
          and
          the lab-boy William, water service was installed and Titus lamps provided the lighting. The classes were
          housed
          in a
          shed made of coconut pillars, mango rafters, corrugated iron roof and wattle-and-daub dwarf walls<img

            alt="Bishop Bede" align="right" id="ContentPlaceHolder1_Image11"><br><br>

          On 16th January 1928, the junior boarders were installed at Katugastota with a solemn planting of trees to
          commemorate the event. The verandah of the old walauwa served as a chapel. Odds and ends served as an altar
          until
          one was made on 29th January and the place was consecrated to the sacred heart of Jesus. Fr. Principal
          himself
          occupied a room between the kindergarten and the study hall.<br>
          Fr. Lawrence Hyde built a formidable team of pioneers - Mr. P.B.A.Weerakoon, Bro. Columban Macky, Bro.
          Joseph,
          Bro.
          Lysons and Bro. Timothy - to set about his vision of transformation that today seems unbelievable. Fr. D.D.
          Barsenbach OSB who was appointed Director of Boarders in 1937 complemented this team. Classes were started
          for
          the
          boarders and others who cared to come over.<br>
          Two lads came all the way past the Kandy school to be in the temporary classes and to share in the spirit of
          the
          new
          St. Anthony's College, which was rising phoenix-like out of the ashes of the old. During the first few years
          the
          school held classes for Kindergarten up to Cambridge Junior, with an approximate staff of around twelve,
          gradually
          increasing the range to the London Matriculation and an Inter-Arts form.<br>
          In 1929, Fr. Hyde had the first permanent set of open classrooms erected alongside the river, which today
          houses
          the
          primary school. It was here, that in 1934, St. Anthony's obtained the best results in the British Empire
          with
          100%
          passes in the London Matriculation Examination. Twelve candidates were presented for the Examination and all
          passed.
          Healthy rivalry was enjoyed by the Katugastota boys with their counterparts from the Kandy school in the
          matter
          of
          success at the Examinations, and more often than not, the Kandy youngsters had to congratulate the
          Katugastota
          lads
          on their performance.<br><br>

          Even in the field of sports, the lads of Katugastota had the better of their counterparts from Kandy in
          cricket
          and
          athletics, first in the under 16 division and later in the 1st&nbsp;Division. From 1936 - 1938, more than
          half
          the
          1st&nbsp;XI cricket team were from the Katugastota school. The boys from Katugastota belonged in those days
          to
          the
          Maroon House while those at Kandy were in the Light and Dark Blue Houses.<br>

          The first playing field at Katugastota was the narrow strip of ground near the entrance on which the present
          Centenary Hall stands. The old Walauwa too is no more. It lies buried under the earth of the present
          playground.
          The
          land around the old Walauwa was thick with cocoa and coconut trees, where cobras roamed. The boys themselves
          helped
          in mopping out operations and the planning and clearing of these areas for vegetable cultivation.<br>

          In 1935, Fr. Hyde completed the main building block of the school and its counterpart running parallel to
          it.
          They
          stand tall to this day to his credit. The hostellers, who had by then increased to about 150, had their
          dormitories
          upstairs in the main block while the Office; Hall, Library and Chapel were on the ground floor. The smaller
          section
          behind which then consisted of a single storey, contained dining rooms and some classrooms. The playing
          field
          too
          was gradually expanded to its present size, thanks to Fr. Van Reyk's share in it. Fr. Robert Perera had the
          first
          Pavilion built at this time.<br><br>

          On the 1st&nbsp;of November 1941, the Kandy branch was officially separated from St. Anthony's College, now
          well
          established at Katugastota, and a new school under the name of 'St. Sylvester's College' was established
          with
          Fr.
          Robert Perera OSB as the first Principal.<br>

          During his record tenure of 23 years (1921 - 1943) as Principal of St. Anthony's, Fr. Lawrence Hyde achieved
          spectacular triumphs in the academic field as well as in sports. On the eve of his career as Principal,
          World
          War II
          brought a dark period through the military occupation of the College. Throughout it all, Fr. Hyde's spirit
          animated
          the skeleton that survived for four years in private houses and cadjan sheds into which she moved through
          compulsion. The total student population shrank to about 300 of which about 50 were boarders. Of all its
          Principals
          of the past, St. Anthony's must be proud of Fr. Lawrence Hyde OSB; not only as it's architect, but also for
          guiding
          with a sure hand it's destinies through a period of 23 years of stress, strain and turmoil. His tenure as
          Principal
          remains the longest, to date.<br><br>

            alt="Viscount Soulbury" id="ContentPlaceHolder1_Image16" align="left">
          &nbsp;In 1944, Fr. Angelo Rosati became Principal, being nominated by Fr. Hyde to carry on the task he had
          begun
          in
          a manner that would raise the prestige of the College as an educational institution of high standards and
          also
          restore the reputation for sports, which had been sidelined for four years during military occupation of the
          College. When the release of the buildings and the playing field came around 1946, one of the first
          innovations
          conceived by Fr. Theophane Wickramaratne, who led the triumphal return of the boys to the premises, was the
          adoption
          of a cottage system for hostel accommodation. Fr. Theophane was also either instrumental or involved in the
          construction of many other College buildings such as "The Rainbow Cottages", The Tuck Shop", " The Chapel",
          "Mansion"' "Villa", "Infirmary", and "The Refectory". Living in small groups, in separate cottages had not
          only
          provided a homely atmosphere but also promoted greater fellowship and understanding. Fr. Rosati immediately
          reconditioned several military huts into cosy, comfortable living quarters for the boarders and appointed
          school
          matrons to be in charge of the physical cleanliness of the boys and the sanitary features of each hostel
          block.
          This
          change had been so effectual in the achievement of greater performance both in work and play and led to a
          remarkable
          reduction of illness among the boarders.<br><br>

          During his sojourn on the Continent, England and the USA, Fr. Rosati was able to send sufficient apparatus
          to
          equip
          fully the Physics, Chemistry and Biology laboratories as well as the Geography room, raising the educational
          standards of the College on par with other leading schools of the Island. The student population grew to a
          near
          1,600 with a teaching staff of 70, during this period. Classes were conducted in English, Sinhala and Tamil
          mediums
          for all subjects from Grade 1 to University Entrance.



          The Antonian cricket teams of subsequent years,
          produced some of the most exciting school boy cricketers with young Wijepala Premaratne
          being adjudged the very first 'All Ceylon School Boy Cricketer' in the year 1956. St.
          Anthony's College also introduced Rugby Football to its list of sports in 1956, with Bruce
          Winter captaining the first team. <br><br>

            declared open by the Rt. Hon. Sir Oliver Goonetilleke, C.M.E. Governor General of
            Ceylon, on the 5th September 1957. On the 11th Fr. Hilarion Rudolph, a Graduate of the
            University of Oxford, came to St.Anthony's as the Principal in 1957, having to succeed a
            Principal of the caliber of Fr.Rosati, whose early demise at the height of his career
            spread a veil of emotionalism in the college. He did good work for the school
            maintaining the high standards the College had already reached. In 1959, the Primary
            School and the Rainbow Cottages lost the services of an able leader in Fr. Leo
            Nanayakkara, who was ordained Bishop of Kandy.</span><br><br>

          In 1961, Fr. Rudolph handed over the reins to Fr. D. I. Robinson OSB, who was at the time
          Warden of the "Mansion" boarding and also Teacher of English. It was during this time that
          the school's takeover was announced. After much heartburn, the government finally permitted
          the College to continue, but non-fee levying. This was a period of great hardship, overcome
          in large measure by the support of the old boys.<br><br>

          <br><br>Many were the instances when Fr. Robinson accompanied by Mr. Victor Perera,
          President of the O.B.A. and later Judge of the Supreme Court, had to visit Old boys, parents
          and well-wishers for donations to keep the College functioning. In spite of these
          adversities, studies and sports continued to maintain high standards during this time. The
          Island wide reputation St. Anthony's enjoyed as a provider of top-drawer sportsmen was
          maintained with Charlie Joseph, a stylish batsman, being selected as 'School Boy Cricketer'
          for two consecutive years.<br><br>

          &nbsp; The College Choir, ably trained and led by Mr. Cyril Brown, also brought many
          trophies to the College mantle. Fr. Robinson also had the support of several other
          Benedictine Priests in Fr. Valentine, Fr. Thomas and Fr. Lanfranc, in running the Boarding,
          which by that time had attracted over 500 students from all parts of the Island, including a
          sizeable number from Colombo.<br><br>

          &nbsp;In 1967, an Old Antonian, Fr. Aidan de Silva OSB was appointed Principal in succession
          to Fr. Robinson. Hard-pressed by the restrictions imposed upon the College as a non-fee
          levying institution, he organized a donation of five years for each new admission to school,
          thus enabling an input of funds. Besides giving the school buildings a complete repair, he
          built the swimming pool, a new Math Laboratory and six modern classrooms. He organized the
          Colours Night on an annual basis commencing 1967 to honour the College sportsmen. Based on a
          suggestion made by Fr. Aidan, the President of the OBA, Mr. R. Victor Perera, launched a
          'Turf Pitch Fund' with his own generous contribution of a Thousand Rupees, at the first
          Central Council meeting of the OBA after the Big Match of 1969. The Turf Pitch was
          completed, blessed by Rt. Rev. Lord Abbot Dom Pio Federici OSB and declared open on the
          30th&nbsp;January 1970 with Fr. Aidan facing the first ball bowled by Mr. Victor Perera.<img

            alt="1500m Event-1967 Sport meet" align="right" id="ContentPlaceHolder1_Image6"><br><br>

          The College Swimming Pool was built during his time and St. Anthony's also excelled in
          Basketball and Tennis, with College producing the best Tennis doubles pair among the
          schools. He was also instrumental in launching the Christmas Carols and Easter programmes
          which were much looked forward to events. During this period, the College Choir was invited
          to perform in a SLBC programme, which was an honour for any College Choir at that time. Fr.
          Aidan was also instrumental in recommencing the regular publication of 'The Antonian'
          magazine.&nbsp;Between the 50's and the 70's, St. Anthony's College had a well-established
          hostel, with over 500 boarders, who came from all parts of the Island. They were spread
          among 14 cottage type dormitories, arranged in succession, according to age groups. The
          hostel was supported by a livestock farm, bakery and a fully equipped sickroom, to cater to
          the needs of the boarders. During this period, the kitchen and refectory at St. Anthony's
          College was the envy of all visiting school teams, who, to this day, talk about the
          sumptuous meals they enjoyed at St. Anthony's.<br><br>

          &nbsp; The unfortunate incident that took place in 1977 changed the identity / status of St.
          Anthony's College Kandy, when the school was handed over to the government by the then
          Bishop of Kandy. In 1977, Fr. Aidan de Silva retired and Fr. Lanfranc Amerasinghe OSB, who
          was warden of hostels took over as the Principal. He had to struggle hard to keep the school
          running as a government institution. He emerged unscathed and handed over the reins of the
          college in 1979 to Fr. Stephen Abraham OSB who had to manage the school with limited
          resources. The hostel was run independent of the school, by the Benedictine Fathers, who
          also had the income generating sections - the hall, the swimming pool and the tuck shop -
          under their jurisdiction. This bifurcation made it difficult for the new Director-managed
          College to survive, minus all its wonted resources. The facility fees of Rs.5/- per student,
          was all it got.<img class="img-thumbnail img-responsive"
            src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/history_3_Rohan-Wijesinghe.jpg" alt="Rohan Wijesinghe" align="right"
            id="ContentPlaceHolder1_Image11"><br><br>

          &nbsp;What Fr. Stephen did do under the circumstances was remarkable. His enthusiasm made
          Hon. R. Premadasa, Prime Minister at the time, donate a two-story block of classrooms, which
          forms one wing of the school and is called the "Premadasa Block". Most of all, he earned the
          fullest cooperation of the old boys to support his bid to elevate the college as a most
          prestigious centre of education, not only in the central province but also in the
          country.<br><br>

          1981 was a memorable year for Antonian Cricket, when they beat Trinity in the Big Match for
          the very first time at the Asgiriya Ground, thus ending what was thought to be a
          jinx.<br><br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1982 the Colombo branch of the OBA undertook a
          gigantic task when, under the presidency of the then minister of Power and Energy, K. D. M.C.
          Bandara, they embarked on a project to develop an Indoor Sports and Pavilion Complex at
          the Katugastota grounds. However, with the communal troubles the country faced since 1983,
          raising funds became a difficult task up to about 1989. The project, named "Bishop Leo
          Nanayakkara Sports and Pavilion Complex", was planned in three stages. The first stage
          consisting of a gymnasium, badminton and table tennis courts was finally completed in 1991
          with the help of funds collected by the old boys and Fr. Stephen Abraham. In March 1992 this
          Sports Complex was officially opened by Mr. K.D.M.C. Bandara and handed over for use by the
          College.<br>
          <br>

          <img class="img-thumbnail img-responsive" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/history_3_Athletic-Team-1978.jpg"
            alt="Atletic team-1978" align="left" id="ContentPlaceHolder1_Image12"><br><br>

          The 'College Diary' was re-introduced in 1987 after a lapse of several years, and has
          continued to be published annually, ever since, making available the yearly plans of College
          to the Antonian community. A Public Address system was installed in 1988, effectively
          enhancing better communication within the vast area of College.<br><br>

          The second stage of the project, which consisted of accommodation for visiting teams, a
          sports pavilion and public stands was named "Jack Anderson Pavilion" after the legendary
          Antonian cricketer. Fund raising for this stage was spearheaded by Fr. Stephen Abraham and
          Minister K. D. M. C Bandara. A total sum of around 4 million Rupees was raised in a very
          short time through donations from parents, old boys, well-wishers and fund raising events
          such as 'Dances' and 'Coffee Mornings' in Colombo and a carnival in Kandy. This effort
          enabled the building to take a shell-shape within a period of just four months and was
          opened by Rev. Fr. Stephen Abraham in March 1993 to commemorate the 75thyear of Jack
          Anderson's unbroken record of 291 runs in a school match against St. Thomas' College, Mt.
          Lavinia. Finishing touches were completed on this building in 1993, and has since, been used
          by the College as its main Pavilion. Work on the third and final stage of the complex
          commenced in 1994.<img class="img-thumbnail img-responsive"
            src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/history_3_Cricket-Team-1991.jpg" alt="Cricket team-1991" align="right"
            id="ContentPlaceHolder1_Image13"><br> <br>

          Fr. Stephen Abraham displayed his strength in standing up fearlessly for the principles he
          believed in, when during the 1988/89 southern revolution, St. Anthony's College became the
          only government school that did not walk out to revolutionary demands.<br><br>

          Other highlights of his stewardship were the Grand School Exhibition in 1979 to mark 125
          years of the school's existence (1854-1979), which was graced by President J.R. Jayawardena
          and celebration of 100 continuous years of Benedictine Monks as Principals (1892-1992). On
          the latter occasion portraits of all past Principals were unveiled in the hall by
          distinguished persons and thanks offered to God for the innumerable blessings bestowed on
          the school through the celebration of a special Holy Mass at which the Archbishop of Colombo
          and the Bishop of Kandy participated.<br><br>

          In 1989 Fr. Stephen Abraham celebrated his Sacerdotal Silver Jubilee (25 years of
          Priesthood) by building 25 houses for the minor staff naming the complex "Anthony Gammana"
          which is a model-housing scheme. His versatility helped the school to achieve high standards
          of performance in sports such as cricket, rugby, etc. while upholding the traditional
          excellence in studies for which the College has been well known.<br><br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Department of Education in recognition
          of the success St. Anthony's had achieved under Fr. Stephen Abraham, approved the
          construction of a new three-storey of buildings at a cost of 8 million rupees, in 1994.<img
            class="img-thumbnail img-responsive" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/history_3_Priyantha-Ekanayaka.jpg"
            alt="Priyantha Ekanayake" align="left" id="ContentPlaceHolder1_Image14"><br><br>

          Fr. Abraham, being a firm believer that true character of students could be judged and
          developed on the playing field and not in the classroom, dedicated much of his time to the
          numerous sporting activities at college. His encouragement of sports paid rich dividends,
          particularly in the success the College enjoyed in Cricket, Rugby, Badminton and Table
          Tennis during the late eighties and early nineties. Many Antonian sportsmen of that era went
          on to represent National teams, with two in particular, receiving international acclaim.
          Priyantha Ekanayake who captained the Sri Lanka Rugby Football team for a record ten years,
          with much success, continues to play a leading role as an administrator and coach at
          national level. The other of course, is the World's Best Off-Spin Bowler in cricket; Muttiah
          Muralitharan, who became the highest wicket taker in one day international cricket and in
          test cricket by breaking Shane Warns world record of 708 wickets<br><br>

          The early and mid nineteen-nineties were some of the best years for sports at St. Anthony's
          College. The Cricketers won three major awards at the 'Island/Pure Beverages' and six major
          awards at the 'Bata/Observer' competitions in 1990. Muttiah Muralitharan - "Best Schoolboy
          Cricketer of the year" &amp; "Best Bowler", Nuwan Kalpage - "Best Captain", and Sajith
          Fernando - "Best Batsman" were among them. Sajith Fernando was also selected the "Best
          All-Rounder" at the 'Bata/Observer' ratings in 1991. The greatest moment however was in
          1993, when three Antonians; Ruwan Kalpage, Muttiah Muralitharan and Piyal Wijetunge were
