                        <p> The Antonian cricket teams of subsequent years,
                            produced some of the
                            most exciting school boy cricketers with young Wijepala Premaratne being adjudged the very
                            first 'All Ceylon School
                            Boy Cricketer' in the year 1956. St. Anthony's College also introduced Rugby Football to its
                            list of sports in 1956,
                            with Bruce Winter captaining the first team. <br><br>

                            declared open by the Rt. Hon. Sir Oliver Goonetilleke, C.M.E. Governor General of
                            Ceylon, on the 5th September
                            1957. On the 11th Fr. Hilarion Rudolph, a Graduate of the University of Oxford, came to
                            St.Anthony's as the
                            Principal in 1957, having to succeed a Principal of the caliber of Fr.Rosati, whose
                            early demise at the height
                            of his career spread a veil of emotionalism in the college. He did good work for the
                            school maintaining the high
                            standards the College had already reached. In 1959, the Primary School and the Rainbow
                            Cottages lost the
                            services of an able leader in Fr. Leo Nanayakkara, who was ordained Bishop of
                            Kandy.</span><br><br>

                            In 1961, Fr. Rudolph handed over the reins to Fr. D. I. Robinson OSB, who was at the time
                            Warden of the "Mansion"
                            boarding and also Teacher of English. It was during this time that the school's takeover was
                            announced. After much
                            heartburn, the government finally permitted the College to continue, but non-fee levying.
                            This was a period of great
                            hardship, overcome in large measure by the support of the old boys.<br><br>

                        <br>Many were the instances when Fr. Robinson accompanied by Mr. Victor Perera,
                        President of the O.B.A. and
                        later Judge of the Supreme Court, had to visit Old boys, parents and well-wishers for
                        donations to keep the College
                        functioning. In spite of these adversities, studies and sports continued to maintain high
                        standards during this
                        time. The Island wide reputation St. Anthony's enjoyed as a provider of top-drawer sportsmen
                        was maintained with
                        Charlie Joseph, a stylish batsman, being selected as 'School Boy Cricketer' for two
                        consecutive years.<br><br>

                        &nbsp; The College Choir, ably trained and led by Mr. Cyril Brown, also brought many
                        trophies to the College mantle.
                        Fr. Robinson also had the support of several other Benedictine Priests in Fr. Valentine, Fr.
                        Thomas and Fr.
                        Lanfranc, in running the Boarding, which by that time had attracted over 500 students from
                        all parts of the Island,
                        including a sizeable number from Colombo.<br><br>

                        &nbsp;In 1967, an Old Antonian, Fr. Aidan de Silva OSB was appointed Principal in succession
                        to Fr. Robinson.
                        Hard-pressed by the restrictions imposed upon the College as a non-fee levying institution,
                        he organized a donation
                        of five years for each new admission to school, thus enabling an input of funds. Besides
                        giving the school buildings
                        a complete repair, he built the swimming pool, a new Math Laboratory and six modern
                        classrooms. He organized the
                        Colours Night on an annual basis commencing 1967 to honour the College sportsmen. Based on a
                        suggestion made by Fr.
                        Aidan, the President of the OBA, Mr. R. Victor Perera, launched a 'Turf Pitch Fund' with his
                        own generous
                        contribution of a Thousand Rupees, at the first Central Council meeting of the OBA after the
                        Big Match of 1969. The
                        Turf Pitch was completed, blessed by Rt. Rev. Lord Abbot Dom Pio Federici OSB and declared
                        open on the
                        30th&nbsp;January 1970 with Fr. Aidan facing the first ball bowled by Mr. Victor Perera.

                        The College Swimming Pool was built during his time and St. Anthony's also excelled in
                        Basketball and Tennis, with
                        College producing the best Tennis doubles pair among the schools. He was also instrumental
                        in launching the
                        Christmas Carols and Easter programmes which were much looked forward to events. During this
                        period, the College
                        Choir was invited to perform in a SLBC programme, which was an honour for any College Choir
                        at that time. Fr. Aidan
                        was also instrumental in recommencing the regular publication of 'The Antonian'
                        magazine.&nbsp;Between the 50's and
                        the 70's, St. Anthony's College had a well-established hostel, with over 500 boarders, who
                        came from all parts of
                        the Island. They were spread among 14 cottage type dormitories, arranged in succession,
                        according to age groups. The
                        hostel was supported by a livestock farm, bakery and a fully equipped sickroom, to cater to
                        the needs of the
                        boarders. During this period, the kitchen and refectory at St. Anthony's College was the
                        envy of all visiting school
                        teams, who, to this day, talk about the sumptuous meals they enjoyed at St.
                        Anthony's.<br><br>

                        &nbsp; The unfortunate incident that took place in 1977 changed the identity / status of St.
                        Anthony's College
                        Kandy, when the school was handed over to the government by the then Bishop of Kandy. In
                        1977, Fr. Aidan de Silva
                        retired and Fr. Lanfranc Amerasinghe OSB, who was warden of hostels took over as the
                        Principal. He had to struggle
                        hard to keep the school running as a government institution. He emerged unscathed and handed
                        over the reins of the
                        college in 1979 to Fr. Stephen Abraham OSB who had to manage the school with limited
                        resources. The hostel was run
                        independent of the school, by the Benedictine Fathers, who also had the income generating
                        sections - the hall, the
                        swimming pool and the tuck shop - under their jurisdiction. This bifurcation made it
                        difficult for the new
                        Director-managed College to survive, minus all its wonted resources. The facility fees of
                        Rs.5/- per student, was
                        all it got.

                        <br><br>

                        &nbsp;What Fr. Stephen did do under the circumstances was remarkable. His enthusiasm made
                        Hon. R. Premadasa, Prime
                        Minister at the time, donate a two-story block of classrooms, which forms one wing of the
                        school and is called the
                        "Premadasa Block". Most of all, he earned the fullest cooperation of the old boys to support
                        his bid to elevate the
                        college as a most prestigious centre of education, not only in the central province but also
                        in the country.<br><br>

                        1981 was a memorable year for Antonian Cricket, when they beat Trinity in the Big Match for
                        the very first time at
                        the Asgiriya Ground, thus ending what was thought to be a jinx.<br><br>

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1982 the Colombo branch of the OBA undertook a
                        gigantic task when,
                        under the presidency of the then minister of Power and Energy, K. D. M. C. Bandara, they
                        embarked on a project to
                        develop an Indoor Sports and Pavilion Complex at the Katugastota grounds. However, with the
                        communal troubles the
                        country faced since 1983, raising funds became a difficult task up to about 1989. The
                        project, named "Bishop Leo
                        Nanayakkara Sports and Pavilion Complex", was planned in three stages. The first stage
                        consisting of a gymnasium,
                        badminton and table tennis courts was finally completed in 1991 with the help of funds
                        collected by the old boys and
                        Fr. Stephen Abraham. In March 1992 this Sports Complex was officially opened by Mr. K.D.M.C.
                        Bandara and handed over
                        for use by the College.<br><br>

                        The 'College Diary' was re-introduced in 1987 after a lapse of several years, and has
                        continued to be published
                        annually, ever since, making available the yearly plans of College to the Antonian
                        community. A Public Address
                        system was installed in 1988, effectively enhancing better communication within the vast
                        area of College.<br><br>

                        he second stage of the project, which consisted of accommodation for visiting teams, a
                        sports pavilion and public
                        stands was named "Jack Anderson Pavilion" after the legendary Antonian cricketer. Fund
                        raising for this stage was
                        spearheaded by Fr. Stephen Abraham and Minister K. D. M. C Bandara. A total sum of around 4
                        million Rupees was
                        raised in a very short time through donations from parents, old boys, well-wishers and fund
                        raising events such as
                        'Dances' and 'Coffee Mornings' in Colombo and a carnival in Kandy. This effort enabled the
                        building to take a
                        shell-shape within a period of just four months and was opened by Rev. Fr. Stephen Abraham
                        in March 1993 to
                        commemorate the 75thyear of Jack Anderson's unbroken record of 291 runs in a school match
                        against St. Thomas'
                        College, Mt. Lavinia. Finishing touches were completed on this building in 1993, and has
                        since, been used by the
                        College as its main Pavilion. Work on the third and final stage of the complex commenced in
                        1994.

                        Fr. Stephen Abraham displayed his strength in standing up fearlessly for the principles he
                        believed in, when during
                        the 1988/89 southern revolution, St. Anthony's College became the only government school
                        that did not walk out to
                        revolutionary demands.<br><br>

                        Other highlights of his stewardship were the Grand School Exhibition in 1979 to mark 125
                        years of the school's
                        existence (1854-1979), which was graced by President J.R. Jayawardena and celebration of 100
                        continuous years of
                        Benedictine Monks as Principals (1892-1992). On the latter occasion portraits of all past
                        Principals were unveiled
                        in the hall by distinguished persons and thanks offered to God for the innumerable blessings
                        bestowed on the school
                        through the celebration of a special Holy Mass at which the Archbishop of Colombo and the
                        Bishop of Kandy
                        participated.<br><br>

                        In 1989 Fr. Stephen Abraham celebrated his Sacerdotal Silver Jubilee (25 years of
                        Priesthood) by building 25 houses
                        for the minor staff naming the complex "Anthony Gammana" which is a model-housing scheme.
                        His versatility helped the
                        school to achieve high standards of performance in sports such as cricket, rugby, etc. while
                        upholding the
                        traditional excellence in studies for which the College has been well known.<br><br>

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Department of Education in recognition
                        of the success St.
                        Anthony's had achieved under Fr. Stephen Abraham, approved the construction of a new
                        three-storey of buildings at a
                        cost of 8 million rupees, in 1994.

                        Fr. Abraham, being a firm believer that true character of students could be judged and
                        developed on the playing
                        field and not in the classroom, dedicated much of his time to the numerous sporting
                        activities at college. His
                        encouragement of sports paid rich dividends, particularly in the success the College enjoyed
                        in Cricket, Rugby,
                        Badminton and Table Tennis during the late eighties and early nineties. Many Antonian
                        sportsmen of that era went on
                        to represent National teams, with two in particular, receiving international acclaim.
                        Priyantha Ekanayake who
                        captained the Sri Lanka Rugby Football team for a record ten years, with much success,
                        continues to play a leading
                        role as an administrator and coach at national level. The other of course, is the World's
                        Best Off-Spin Bowler in
                        cricket; Muttiah Muralitharan, who became the highest wicket taker in one day international
                        cricket and in test
                        cricket by breaking Shane Warns world record of 708 wickets<br><br>

                        The early and mid nineteen-nineties were some of the best years for sports at St. Anthony's
                        College. The Cricketers
                        won three major awards at the 'Island/Pure Beverages' and six major awards at the
                        'Bata/Observer' competitions in
                        1990. Muttiah Muralitharan - "Best Schoolboy Cricketer of the year" &amp; "Best Bowler",
                        Nuwan Kalpage - "Best
                        Captain", and Sajith Fernando - "Best Batsman" were among them. Sajith Fernando was also
                        selected the "Best
                        All-Rounder" at the 'Bata/Observer' ratings in 1991. The greatest moment however was in
                        1993, when three Antonians;
                        Ruwan Kalpage, Muttiah Muralitharan and Piyal Wijetunge were selected to play for Sri Lanka
                        in the first Test Match
                        against South Africa. A fourth Antonian; Sajith Fernando was also in the reckoning but sadly
                        missed out. Mahesh
                        Gunatilleke, Bernard Perera and Marlon Von Haght were the other Antonians to have
                        represented Sri Lanka at Test
                        Cricket in the nineteen-eighties.

                        The Paddlers, spearheaded by Christopher Arnolda &amp; Umesh de Alwis brought much fame to
                        College. Arnolda was
                        seeded No: 1 and Alwis No: 5 at National level, and both went on to represent Sri Lanka in
                        later years.<br><br>

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Shuttlers dominated the local schools
                        Badminton tournaments
                        through most of the last decade of the century, with as many as ten Antonians winning
                        National Titles.<br><br>

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ruggerites continued to hold their own
                        against top Rugby
                        Schools, and was a major feeder of quality ruggerites to the local club teams in Kandy &amp;
                        Colombo, with many
                        Antonians going on to represent the Country. The Old Antonians Rugby Football Club has been
                        a major support base
                        ever since their inauguration in the early nineteen-nineties.<br><br>

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having served as Principal for sixteen long
                        years (1979 - 1994),
                        Fr. Stephen Abraham retired, content with what he had achieved for St. Anthony's College
                        Kandy. He was the second
                        longest serving Principal, next to Fr. Lawrence Hyde.<br><br>

                        Fr. Hilarion Fernando OSB succeeded Fr. Stephen Abraham in April 1994, and completed ten
                        years in the seat on the
                        auspicious occasion of the Sesquicentennial of College. He is also the fifteenth member of
                        the 'Sylvestro
                        Benedictine Order' (OSB) to hold the post, in 112 years. Prior to his appointment as
                        Principal, Fr. Hilarion served
                        as Warden of Hostels from 1983 - 1991, and as Head Master of the Primary Department from
                        1990 - 1994.<br><br>

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Old Boys Association Parent Body and
                        Colombo Branch jointly
                        organized a Gala Dinner at the Hotel Suisse - Kandy, on 5th&nbsp;November 1994, to bid
                        farewell to Fr. Stephen
                        Abraham and to welcome Fr. Hilarion Fernando.<br><br>

                        The OBA (Colombo Branch) published a directory of Old Antonians, titled "Antonian
                        Connection", in 1994. This spiral
                        bound publication was not only a first for Antonians, but also the first of its kind among
                        all schools.<br><br>

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The College Council inaugurated in 1972,
                        functioned continuously as
                        the supreme body of decision making on matters pertaining to College within the frame of
                        rules and regulations of
                        the Department of Education. The Council consists of twelve members at present, headed by
                        Rev. Fr. Principal and
                        including Prefect of Discipline, Prefect of Games, Sectional Heads and Staff Guild
                        President. The Sports Council,
                        which was formed subsequently, continues to govern on all matters relating to sports. Headed
                        by Rev. Fr. Principal,
                        the Council consists of Masters in Charge and Coaches of each sport.

                        &nbsp;The third and final stage of the "Bishop Leo Nanayakkara Sports and Pavilion Complex",
                        was completed in 2000,
                        with the Badminton Courts within the complex being upgraded with Air-cushioned flooring in
                        1999, to accommodate
                        National Tournaments.<br><br>

                        The three storeyed block in the upper school was completed in 2001. The "Sesquicentennial
                        Block" of classrooms in
                        the quadrangular was completed with the assistance of parents of the upper school, in 2003.
                        The Primary section too
                        received a new block of four classrooms and a computer laboratory in 2002. Computers and
                        related equipment for the
                        laboratory were obtained through funds collected by parents of the Primary section. A new
                        'Jubilee Building' was
                        constructed for the Primary in 2003, through the collective efforts of the parents.

                        The student population averaged 2,700, with 2100 in the Sinhala Medium and 600 in the Tamil
                        Medium. The Academic
                        Staff progressively increased with development of curriculum.<br><br>

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; High standards were maintained in National
                        Examinations with an
                        increase in passes at the G.C.E. (O/L), in Sinhala medium, as well as in Tamil medium. Both
                        mediums have also
